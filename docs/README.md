## ✅ Adding to do tasks

To Do tasks are tasks that need to be done but do not have a specific deadline or event date.
They are your everyday tasks that you need to remember.

Example: `todo <task_name>`

Chiikawa will then add the task to your list and confirm the addition.

## ⏰ Adding tasks with deadlines
Deadline tasks are tasks that need to be done by a specific date and time.

Example: `deadline <task_name> /<yyyy-mm-dd>`

Example: `deadline <task_name> /<any time>`

## 📅 Adding tasks that are events
Event tasks are tasks that occur at a specific date and time.

Example: `event <task_name> /<start time in yyyy-mm-dd> /<end time in yyyy-mm-dd>`

Example: `event <task_name> /<start time in any time> /<end time in any time>`

## 🔝 Updating priorities of tasks
You can assign priorities to your tasks to help you manage your time better. There are two levels of priority: HIGH and LOW.
By default, all tasks are assigned a LOW priority.

Example: `priority <task_number> <HIGH/LOW>`

## 🗑️ Deleting tasks
To delete a task, you need to specify the task number that you want to delete. The task number can be found by listing all tasks.

Example: `delete <task_number>`

## 🔍 Finding tasks
To find a task, you can use the find command followed by a keyword. Chiikawa will then search through your tasks and return any tasks that contain the keyword in their names.

Example: `find <keyword>`

## ✔️ Marking tasks as done

Example: `mark <task_number>`

## ❌ Marking tasks as not done
